A simple plugin to enable automatic updates to your GitHub or Bitbucket hosted WordPress plugins and themes.

This plugin is not allowed in the wp.org repo. :frowning:

## Description

This plugin was designed to simply update any GitHub hosted WordPress plugin or theme. Your plugin or theme **must** contain a header in the style.css header or in the plugin's header denoting the location on GitHub. The format is as follows. The folder name of the theme or plugin **must** be the same as the repo name.

`GitHub Theme URI: afragen/test-child`  
`GitHub Theme URI: https://github.com/afragen/test-child`

or 

`GitHub Plugin URI: afragen/github-updater`  
`GitHub Plugin URI: https://github.com/afragen/github-updater`

...where the above URI leads to the __owner/repository__ of your theme or plugin. The URI may be in the format `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` or the short format `<owner>/<repo>`.

## Installation

### Composer

run the composer command : ``` composer require afragen/github-updater```


### Upload

1. Download the latest tagged archive (choose the "zip" option).
2. Go to the __Plugins -> Add New__ screen and click the __Upload__ tab.
3. Upload the zipped archive directly.
4. Go to the Plugins screen and click __Activate__.

### Manual

1. Download the latest tagged archive (choose the "zip" option).
2. Unzip the archive.
3. Copy the folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
4. Go to the Plugins screen and click __Activate__.

Check out the Codex for more information about [installing plugins manually](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

### Git

Using git, browse to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and clone this repository:

`git clone git@github.com:afragen/github-updater.git`

Then go to your Plugins screen and click __Activate__.

### Must Use Plugin

1. Choose a method from above for installation
1. Symlink `wp-content/plugins/github-updater/mu/ghu-loader.php` in `wp-content/mu-plugins`
1. Symlink the plugin directory as `wp-content/muplugins/github-updater`
1. Do not activate the normal plugin!

```
# in Linux
ln -sv wp-content/plugins/github-updater/mu/ghu-loader.php wp-content/mu-plugins/ghu-loader.php
ln -sv wp-content/plugins/github-updater wp-content/mu-plugins/github-updater

:: in Windows (Vista, 7, 8)
mklink wp-content\mu-plugins\ghu-loader.php wp-content\plugins\github-updater\mu\ghu-loader.php
mklink /D wp-content\muplugins\github-updater wp-content\plugins\github-updater
```

#### Pro

Automatic update.

#### Contra

Shouldn't be activated as a normal plugin. [PR-s](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/fork) are welcome for this purpose.

## Usage

### Themes

There must be a `GitHub Theme URI` or `Bitbucket Theme URI` declaration in the `style.css` file.

~~~css
/*
Theme Name:       Test
Theme URI:        http://drfragen.info/
Version:          0.1.0
Description:      Child theme of TwentyTwelve.
Author:           Andy Fragen
Template:         twentytwelve
Template Version: 1.0.0
GitHub Theme URI: https://github.com/afragen/test-child
GitHub Branch:    master
*/
~~~

### Plugins 

There must be a `GitHub Plugin URI` or `Bitbucket Plugin URI` declaration in the plugin's header. The plugin's primary file **must** be named similarly to the repo name.

~~~php
/*
Plugin Name:       GitHub Updater
Plugin URI:        https://github.com/afragen/github-updater
Description:       A plugin to automatically update GitHub hosted plugins and themes into WordPress. Plugin class based upon <a href="https://github.com/codepress/github-plugin-updater">codepress/github-plugin-updater</a>. Theme class based upon <a href="https://github.com/WordPress-Phoenix/whitelabel-framework">Whitelabel Framework</a> modifications.
Version:           1.0.0

License URI:       http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
Domain Path:       /languages

GitHub Plugin URI: https://github.com/afragen/github-updater
GitHub Branch:     master
*/
~~~

Optional headers `GitHub Access Token`, `GitHub Branch`, and `Bitbucket Branch` are available but not required.

## Branch Support

To specify a branch that you would like to use for updating, just add a `GitHub Branch` header.  If you develop on `master` and are pushing tags, GitHub Updater will update to the newest tag. If there are no tags or the specified branch is not `master` GitHub Updater will use the specified branch for updating.

The default state is either `GitHub Branch: master` or nothing at all. They are equivalent.

If you want to update against branch of your repository other than `master` and have that branch push updates out to users make sure you specify the testing branch in a header, i.e. `GitHub Branch: develop`. When you want users to update against the release branch just have them manually change the header to `GitHub Branch: master` or remove it completely. Tags will be ignored when a branch other than `master` is specified. In this case I would suggest semantic versioning similar to the following, `<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<development>`.

## Tagging

If `GitHub Branch` or `Bitbucket Branch` is not specified (or is set to `master`), then the latest tag will be used. GitHub Updater will preferentially use a tag over a branch in this instance.

## Bitbucket Support

The `Bitbucket Branch` header is supported for both plugins and themes.

### Bitbucket Plugin Support

Instead of the `GitHub Plugin URI` header you will need to use the `Bitbucket Plugin URI` header.

### Bitbucket Theme Support

Instead of the `GitHub Theme URI` header you will need to use the `Bitbucket Theme URI` header.

## Private Repositories

### GitHub Private Repositories

In order to specify a private repository you will need to obtain a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). Once you have this, simply add the header `GitHub Access Token: xxxxxxxxx` to your plugin or theme.

### Bitbucket Private Repositories

The header should be in the following format: `Bitbucket Plugin URI: https://<user>:<password>@bitbucket.org/<owner>/<repo>` or `Bitbucket Theme URI: https://<user>:<password>@bitbucket.org/<owner>/<repo>`

Regrettably, I still get an error when trying to download a Bitbucket private repository. I could use some [help in figuring this one out](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/issues/59).

## Deleting Transients

If you use the **Check Again** button in the WordPress Updates screen then all the transients will be deleted and the API will be queried again. Be careful about refreshing the browser window after this as you may be continually deleting the transients.

## Hosting Plugin in WP.org Repository

If you develop your plugin on GitHub and it also resides in the WP.org repo, the plugin will preferentially pull updates from WP.org if `GitHub Branch: master`. If `GitHub Branch` is anything other than `master` then the update will pull from GitHub. Make sure that the version of your plugin uploaded to WP.org has `GitHub Branch: master`.

The same applies for Bitbucket hosted plugins.

## Issues

Please log issues on the GitHub at https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/issues

If you are using a WordPress Multisite installation, the plugin **should** be network activated.

When first downloading and installing a plugin from GitHub you might have to do the following.

1. Unzip the archive.
2. Fix the folder name to remove to extra stuff GitHub adds to the download, like _-master_.
3. Copy the folder to your plugins directory.
