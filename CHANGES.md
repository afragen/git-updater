#### 4.3.1
* Spanish translation by [Jose Miguel Bejarano](https://github.com/xDae)
* squish PHP notices
* add custom user agent to `wp_remote_get` and tweak error message at request of GitHub ;-)

#### 4.3.0
* use @WPUpdatePhp `class WPUpdatePhp` for PHP version checking
* use https://api.wordpress.org not http
* Arabic translation by [Hyyan Abo FAkher](https://github.com/hyyan)
* make strings better for translation - thanks @pedro-mendonca and @fxbenard

#### 4.2.0
* added minutes until reset of GitHub API's rate limit to error message

* Swedish translation by [Andréas Lundgren](https://github.com/Adevade)
* added logo to README and Settings page

#### 4.1.3
* use `strtolower` comparison of plugin directory and repo name. This might is an issue related to the manual installation of a plugin before any update might occur. This allows the **View details** screen to display in these instances where the case of the directory and repo aren't identical. This doesn't work for themes.

* Special thanks for all my translators, especially @grappler for adding translation key for description
* bugfix to correctly pick CHANGES.MD or CHANGELOG.MD regardless of case

* Settings page **only** shows private repos, except for initial setup

#### 3.0.7
* more efficient solution to HTTP Authentication issues
* more efficient options cleanup
* remove some unnecessary code resulting in few database calls
* change default option setting to use `add_site_option` so not autoloading options

#### 3.0.6

#### 2.9.0
* move instantiation of `class GitHub_Plugin_Updater` and `class GitHub_Theme_Updater` into `GitHub_Updater::init()` and restrict to `current_user_can( 'update_plugins' )` and `current_user_can( 'update_themes' )` so that non-privileged users don't incur load time.
* now loading classes via `spl_autoload_register`
* switched to `erusev/parsedown` for rendering changelogs, faster and more light-weight.
* now parses remote file info to save only file headers to transient. Hopefully speeds up database retrieval of transient.
* added README link to GitHub Link plugin by @szepeviktor
* added mu-plugin option and instructions.
* above revisions mostly due to @szepeviktor prodding me. ;-)
* accept `CHANGES.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` for processing, for @GaryJ

#### 2.8.1
* fix for WP Coding Guidelines
* added check for upgrade process instead of `$_GET['action']` (props @SLv99)
* launch classes from `GitHub_Updater::init()` so can load in `add_action( 'init', ...` from `__construct()`.

#### 2.8.0
* refactor API classes and `class GitHub_Updater` to add extra headers from API class. This should allow for better abstraction. Just need to call `GitHub_Updater_{repo}_API::add_headers()` in `class GitHub_Plugin_Updater` and `class GitHub_ Theme_Updater`.
* remove @since tags
* move `maybe_authenticate_http` to `class GitHub_Updater_Bitbucket_API` as it's not used elsewhere
* use non-strict check for http response code (thanks @echav)

* fixed transient assignment for tags returning empty array.
* added transient for `CHANGES.md` to themes, should further cut down on API 403 errors.

#### 2.3.2
* rewrite of `GitHub_Update_GitHub_API::construct_download_link` to download zipball and provide appropriate endpoint.

#### 2.3.1
* now saving transient and adding early return if API returns 404, this should speed up plugin when repo doesn't have `CHANGES.md` file and provide for early return in no tags have been created. If no tags have been created the API is still hit.

#### 2.3.0
* moved action hook to remove `after_theme_row_$stylesheet` to `class GitHub_Theme_Updater`
* added feature: if branch other than `master` is specified then tagged version will be ignored. This should make it much easier for beta testing to groups. See [README.md](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/blob/develop/README.md)
* converted `class GitHub_Update_GitHub_API` to extension of `class GitHub_Updater`
* combined `description` and `changelog` to show in theme detail view. Rough formatting. Multisite only.

* fix for setting download link when API not responding
* redesigned filter for setting transient timeout, but still not working (pull requests welcome)

* `get_remote_tag` uses transient to limit calls to API
